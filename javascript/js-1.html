    <h1>Heading</h1>

    <p>Lorem ipsum" is standard, meaningless placeholder text used in publishing and design to show how a layout looks with text, focusing on visual form (typography, spacing) rather than content, derived from scrambled Latin text (Cicero) but altered to be nonsensical, and popularized by Letraset and desktop publishing software like PageMaker</p>

    <script>
        console.log("Hello from web page.");
    </script>
